# Explain Like I’m 5 (ELI5)

Explain Like I’m 5 is a concept-explanation project designed to break down complex ideas into simple, intuitive explanations using everyday language and real-life analogies.

The goal is not to be technically exhaustive, but to make sure the *core idea actually makes sense* — even to someone with zero background knowledge.

## The Problem

Most educational and technical content assumes prior knowledge.
As a result:
- Beginners feel overwhelmed
- Concepts feel intimidating
- Learning becomes memorization instead of understanding

There’s plenty of information — but not enough **clarity**.

---

## The Idea

If you truly understand something, you should be able to explain it simply.

This project follows one rule:
> Explain concepts the way you would to a 5-year-old — clearly, patiently, and without jargon.

---

## What This Project Does

- Converts complex topics into beginner-friendly explanations  
- Uses analogies, stories, and familiar examples  
- Removes unnecessary technical jargon  
- Focuses on intuition before depth  

Each explanation is short, relatable, and confidence-building.

## Example

**Topic:** Neural Networks  

**Explanation:**  
Imagine a group of tiny decision-makers passing messages to each other.  
Each one decides whether the message is important before passing it forward.  
Over time, they learn which messages matter most — that’s how neural networks learn.

## Who This Is For

- Students learning a new subject  
- Non-technical professionals exploring tech concepts  
- Interview preparation and revision  
- Anyone who wants clarity without complexity
